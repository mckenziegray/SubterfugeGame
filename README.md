# Subterfuge
Subterfuge is a strategy game of espionage. Its gameplay is similar to that of the party game [Mafia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mafia_(party_game)), and more directly inspired by the online multiplayer game [Town of Salem](https://www.blankmediagames.com/), but designed for a single player.

Currently designed for web, but I eventually want to port to mobile and maybe even desktop.
