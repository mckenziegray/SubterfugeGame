# SubterfugeGame
Subterfuge is a strategy game of espionage. Its gameplay is similar to that of the party game [Mafia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mafia_(party_game)), and more directly inspired by the online multiplayer game [Town of Salem](https://www.blankmediagames.com/), but designed for a single player.

Eventually, I would like this game to work on all of the following platforms (prioritized in this order):
1. Web
2. Android
3. iOS
4. Windows
5. Linux/MacOS
